# Introduction #
I simutaneously work with several software projects. Each project has its own coding standard and rule. Therefore, it is neccessary to have a particular configuraiton for each project.

The exrc option is utilized for the project-based setting. 


# How to do configuration for project-based setting #

The option 'exrc' is off by default. If it is on, vim search the current directory for the following files until the first file is found. The other will be ignored. 
+ .vimrc
+ \_vimrc
+ .exrc
